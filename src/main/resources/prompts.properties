# Architectural overview prompt - used during initial architecture analysis
# Provides a short 3-4 sentence overview of the project
prompt.architectural.overview=Provide a technical project overview of this repository in 3-4 sentences. Focus on: (1) project type and purpose, (2) architectural style, (3) technology stack, (4) maturity level. Be direct and avoid showing your analysis process. Output only the final overview, no explanations or debug steps.

# Project overview prompt - used to generate a concise description based on detected facts
# Variables substituted: buildTool, language, hasTests, hasCi, usesSpring, hasDatabaseIntegration
prompt.project.overview=Analyze this repository and write a 2-3 sentence project overview. Be factual and specific.\n\nRepository Facts:\nBuild tool: %s\nLanguage: %s\nTests present: %s\nCI/CD configured: %s\nUses Spring Framework: %s\nDatabase integration: %s\n\nWrite a description that:\n1. Identifies the project type (CLI tool, library, web application, etc.)\n2. States its primary purpose based on structure\n3. Notes key technology choices (Maven/Gradle, test presence, CI status)\n\nKeep it to exactly 2-3 sentences. Be direct and technical.\n\nOverview:

# Comprehensive analysis template - used for detailed repository assessment
# Variables substituted: projectName, buildTool, language, packaging, totalFiles, totalClasses, totalTestClasses, approximateLinesOfCode, topLevelPackages, largestFiles, frameworks, externalDependencies, testsPresent, ciPresent
prompt.comprehensive.analysis=Analyze this Java repository comprehensively. Provide specific, measurable assessments based on the facts provided.\n\n=== REPOSITORY FACTS ===\nProject: {{projectName}}\nBuild System: {{buildTool}}\nLanguage: {{language}}\nTotal Files: {{totalFiles}} | Classes: {{totalClasses}} | Test Classes: {{totalTestClasses}} | Approximate LOC: {{approximateLinesOfCode}}\nPackage Structure: {{topLevelPackages}}\nLargest Files: {{largestFiles}}\nFrameworks: {{frameworks}}\nExternal Dependencies: {{externalDependencies}}\nTesting Status: {{testsPresent}}\nCI/CD Status: {{ciPresent}}\n\n=== ANALYSIS REQUIRED ===\n\n1. ARCHITECTURAL STYLE (1-2 sentences)\nIdentify the dominant architectural pattern (e.g., modular, layered, service-oriented, plugin-based). Base this on package structure and size distribution.\n\n2. KEY RISKS (2-3 specific risks with brief explanation each)\nEvaluate risks in these categories: maintainability (codebase complexity), test coverage ({{totalTestClasses}} test classes for {{totalClasses}} classes), deployment readiness (CI status: {{ciPresent}}), and dependency management.\n\n3. MAINTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT (1 sentence with rating)\nRate as Good/Fair/Poor based on: test coverage ratio, file size distribution, and package organization. Reference specific numbers.\n\n4. PRODUCTION READINESS (1-2 sentences)\nAssess based on: test coverage, CI/CD presence ({{ciPresent}}), and codebase maturity. Identify blocking issues if any.\n\n5. THREE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS\nProvide actionable improvements for this specific project type. Reference actual metrics or package names where possible.\n\n=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===\nRespond with these five sections clearly labeled. Be specific, reference the data provided, use the actual numbers and names from this repository.
